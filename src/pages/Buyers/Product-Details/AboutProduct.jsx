                        If you are limited with space in your kitchen, this dishwasher could answer
                        your problem. It sits behind a cupboard door, fully integrating into your
                        kitchen. It's around 15cm slimmer than most full size dishwashers which
                        means you dont need to give up too much storage space for it to sit. And
                        that doesn't mean you'll be short of space inside either â€“ it'll hold 110
                        pieces (around 10 place settings) in one load. Inside there are two spacious
                        baskets, with the bottom being ideal for bigger items. If you need more
                        room, you can even adjust the height of the upper basket to fit those
                        awkward pots and pans inside. The controls are all within easy reach,
                        sitting on the top edge of the door when opened. Add your detergent to the
                        dispenser, choose the perfect settings and away you go! Don't worry if
                        you've not got a full load to wash, just choose the half load function and
                        it'll use just enough water and energy to get the job done. There's always a
                        programme to suit your load, again only using as much energy and water as it
                        needs for the best results. They include intensive, eco, 90 mins and rapid.
                        You can even delay your wash to start at the best time for you, perfect for
                        getting the pots clean and ready for when you get home from work. Choose
                        from a three, six or nine-hour delay to suit your day.
